It does not matter if you are using a Rest API or any other way of data input i.e. kafka consumers.
Albanoi cares only what's in your domain layer.

Below you can see two different scenarios where albanoi works as designed.

When you have a rest controller, which is used to execute http requests
against our application that controller can prepare the domain commands and execute them
using the albanoi gateway. The gateway itself will find the registered handler for you command and
return the handler result.

The same can be done using a kafka consumer, once you deserialize the message
you can prepare your domain command and execute it, similar to rest controllers.
